The cardline project 
====================


There is a simple game project make with [Haxeflixel](http://haxeflixel.com/).

The game is based on [CardLine/Timeline board game](https://www.asmodee.us/en/games/timeline/).

I made this project to understand the philosophy of HaxeFlixel. So there are many ugly code because of testing.

I Stream the development at https://www.twitch.tv/breakfast_fr . Feel free to say hello :p

If you want to compile it, you need to [install & configure Haxeflixel](http://haxeflixel.com/documentation/getting-started/)
