How to create an extention

#################################


1 - Create the extention folder
_______________________________

First, you need to create a new folder : assets/extentions/{extentionName}/
Second, you need to create the illustration folder : assets/extentions/{extentionName}/illus/
Third, you must create the JSON extention file definition : assets/extentions/{extentionName}/{extentionName}.json

2 - Define the extention 
________________________

- Open  the definition file ("assets/extentions/{extentionName}/{extentionName}.json")
- Copie The data from "Assets/extentions/defExtentionTemplate.json" to your json file

Json Key explained here : 

"name" :					The Ingame name of your extention

"background" :				relative path (relative to the .exe) to the card background. You can use the default Card background, or use a custum.

"illusFolder" :				relative path (relative to the .exe) to the illustration folder.  (where cards load there illustration)

"unitsName" (optionnal): 	A key/data object represent the units of game value.
							if a card have "pound" game value, you can specify here that "pound" unit is "kg". 
							It's global to all card of this extention (you can't specify multiple unit name for one value for now)
				

"cards":					An Array of Card Definition (See 3 - card definition of this document)


3 - Card Definition
___________________

Card definition must be add into the array "cards" JSON value. See exemple into "Assets/extentions/defExtentionTemplate.json"


"name": 					The ingame name of the card (must be unique)

"illustration":				The file name of the illustration (.jpg or .png only). The file must be in "illusFolder" define earlier

"wikilink" (optionnal):		An external link to a web page to have some information about the card (if exist, an ingame button is adding on the card to open the link)

"values": 					A key/data object represent the ingame value to play with. You can define several custom values. 
							All card can have different value. But remember, to be valid for a specific value, an extention must have 10+ card with the same value


4 - Subscribe the extention to the catalog
__________________________________________

Open "assets/extentions/extCatalog.json" and add this object to the structure : 
	
{
	"uniqueId":"{your_unique_id}",
	"extentionFolder":"extention_folder_name",
	"extentionFile":"{extentionName}.json"
}

"uniqueId":				Must be unique on the catalog. A good idea to name it is to follow this schema : {langage}.{author}.{extName}
"extentionFolder": 		The name of your extention folder created on step 1/ (only the folder name, not the path.)
"extentionFile":		The name of yout JSON extention definition file (just the name, not the path);


4 - Other Informations
______________________

- A tool to check if all of your JSON is valid : https://jsonlint.com/
- An extention is valid only if it have 10+ cards define AND have a valid Game Value
- A game value (year, pound, etc.) is valid only if there are 10+ cards in the extention with this value 
- An invalid extention is not show in game on screen Extention/value choice
- The card background size is : 265*350 px
- Cards' illustration size is : 253*268 px
- if an illustration or a background exceed the size below, there are automatically resize in game. But please, to save memory, try to keep these size (or the same ratio)
